**üìä Summary Statistics**

* **Total commits:** 13
* **Time period:** Last 24 hours
* **Contributors involved:** Sumit Ridhal


**üéØ Key Developments**

This past 24 hours has seen significant progress on the partner platform, focusing primarily on enhancing the search functionality, integrating GraphQL, and improving the preview section.  Key developments include:

* **GraphQL Integration:**  Added Apollo Client and GraphQL, significantly improving data fetching and management.  This lays the groundwork for future API improvements and scalability.
* **Partner Search Enhancements:**  Implemented robust search functionality within the partner list, dramatically improving user experience.  This involved considerable refactoring of the `PartnerList` component and related API calls.
* **Preview Section Overhaul:**  A new `PartnerOfferingsSection` was added to the preview, and other preview components were restructured and exported for better reusability. Three new images were also added as assets.
* **Partner Page Restructuring:**  Extensive refactoring of partner pages to improve organization and maintainability.  This involved significant changes to several components, and may require additional testing.
* **API Enhancements:** New APIs were added to fetch partner offerings and search results via GraphQL, improving the efficiency and consistency of data retrieval.


**üìÅ Files & Areas Affected**

The majority of changes impact the frontend (React components and associated styling), with some changes to backend API calls and models.  Specific areas affected include:

* **Frontend:**  `src/components/` (particularly `preview` and `search` subdirectories), `src/features/partner`, `src/features/api`, `src/models`, `src/layout`, `src/index.scss`.  Most changes involve React components and their related stylesheets.
* **Backend/API:**  Significant changes in `src/features/api/`  (GraphQL setup, partner offering and search queries)
* **Configuration:**  `package.json` (addition of Apollo Client and GraphQL dependencies), `package-lock.json`.
* **Impact Assessment:** The changes are substantial and may require thorough testing, especially those related to the refactoring and GraphQL integration.


**üîÑ Development Patterns**

* **Types of changes:** Primarily feature additions (new search, GraphQL, preview sections), with significant refactoring efforts.
* **Development activity intensity:** High activity concentrated within the last hour.
* **Notable patterns:**  A focus on improving the partner platform's search, data fetching, and preview sections, suggesting a planned, iterative development approach.


**üí° Insights & Recommendations**

* **Code quality observations:** The commit messages are generally informative. However, more detailed commit messages describing the "why" behind the changes would improve code understanding and maintainability.
* **Potential areas of concern:** The significant refactoring of partner pages and related components requires thorough testing to ensure functionality and backward compatibility.  Consider adding unit and integration tests for these areas.  The intensity of commits in a short timeframe might suggest a need for more incremental development and code reviews.
* **Suggested next steps:**
    * Complete thorough testing of all changes, especially those related to the refactoring and GraphQL integration.
    * Review and potentially refactor large files (e.g., `src/components/search/PartnerSearchPage.tsx`) to improve maintainability.
    * Add comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure stability and prevent regression issues.
    * Implement a code review process to ensure quality and consistency.
